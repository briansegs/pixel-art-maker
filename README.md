# pixel-art-maker

This is a webpage I made for the "Pixel Art Maker" project from Udacity.

On the webpage you can create beautiful art one pixel at a time!
Some of the features:
* You can choose your grid size and proportions.
* Pick from a full pallet of colors.
* When you want, clear the canvas for a clear start.
* A site design that will inspire you creativitly.  

## How to use the site
Go to this link: [Pixel Art Maker!](https://briansegs.github.io/pixel-art-maker/)
1. Select your canvas height and width. Click the submit button to create your new canvas. 
2. Select the color you'd like to paint with.
3. Click a block on the canvas to make it the color you have selected.
4. Have fun and make something cool!
